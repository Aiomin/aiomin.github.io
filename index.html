		<h1>Aiomin Studios</h1>
		<p>Aiomin Studios is a company of innovative technology creators and explorers. Over the last six years, the team has been very selective of the projects that it has chosen to engage in, preferring quality over quantity. Aiomin has developed game design proposals, web applications, IoT solutions, and research-driven products within the spheres of education, transportation, and health.</p>
		<p>Aiominâ€™s goal is generally to facilitate the progression of ideas to the first light of production. This is often the less beaten path as the ideas, products, and solutions the team has created typically are novel ways and approaches for solving given problems.</p>
		<p>Aiomin started in 2014 as a collaboration of engineering, business analysis, and design. It has partnered with i2i winners, researchers, and innovators to bring advance their product ideas. Most recently, Aiomin collaborated with UTT researcher Dr. Amalia Hosein to launch a health-based mobile application on Android, iOS, and the web.</p>
		<p>Aiomin Studios is a project-focused company. As it executes on projects, it uses that for research, exploration, and development. Its most recent project was valued at TTD 45,000.00. This project was to develop a cardiovascular-based app, in 2019. Before that, Aiomin Studios worked on an RFID transportation solution.</p>
		<p>The Aiomin team consists of business developer, Andre Edwards; design lead, Ikechi Griffith and software engineer, Irwin Williams. </p>
